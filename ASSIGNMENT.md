# Module Documentation

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. 
##### 1 cont. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I had never really looked too much into the details of an API before this assignment, and they are both more complicated than I thought in some ways,
but at the same time more accessible than I had anticipated in others. After looking though many different APIs, it became easier to grasp how they were stored,
such as knowing the structure of where to look for files (i.e. lib/ or src/), and how to find specific examples if they weren't explicitly in an examples folder.
One aspect that made the module easy to understand was the layout of the functions was easy to follow, and obviously built on each other.
One part that made it difficult was the fact that some of the names of the variables got pretty confusing, especially
when dealing with different code, codes, coutnries, country codes, as well as abbreviated versions such as c.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Raising the level of abstraction essentially is simplifying what is happening. If you are simply translating the code into english, then it's not
a comment, it's just a translation. If I were to explain comments to a CSE 142 student, I would say to make the comment readable to someone
who doesn't really know code, or at least not in the language it's written. A comment should encapsulate the result of the function
without going into the inner workings of it. 


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> It took me around 7 hours to finish the assignment, counting the time spent deciding which API to use.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Just the material suggested on the homework spec. No outside help.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> It was much harder to decide which API to use than I had anticipated. Some may seem appropriate at first, but 
then you realize it is too in depth, requires some proprietary software, or is downright too confusing to do the
assignment on!
